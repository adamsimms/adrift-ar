### Artist Statement
Adrift elides physical and virtual space while challenging ephemeral notions of home. The digital structure floats perpetually on the Atlantic Ocean. As the viewer experiences the piece, the house drifts and turns as if floating in physical space. Adrift is a historical representation of my grandmother's experience of her resettled home and, by extension, all resettled homes. The house also acts as another form of resettlement to a third, imaginary dimension still influenced by its geographical context: whereby the image prevails over the thing it is an image of (Virilio 25). The virtual space, linked to an actual place, becomes a â€œthird space of hybridity" accessed by the window of technology (Ang 170). While technology allows us to access this hybrid space, it also challenges the real and actual, the near and far. It reminds us that neither a resettled resident nor their home can ever return to their origins.
